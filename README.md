- Open PRs against the main (default) branch with clear descriptions and linked issues.

PR checklist
- [ ] Code builds locally
- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] Linting/formatting applied
- [ ] Documentation updated where applicable

Styling & commits
- Use Prettier for formatting.
- ESLint for linting.
- Commit message style: type(scope): short description (e.g., feat(api): add travel suggestions endpoint)

Upgrading JS -> TS (recommendation)
- Convert one module at a time.
- Add tsconfig.json with strict-ish settings and incrementally enable more strict options.
- Keep JS and TS interoperable using "allowJs" if needed during migration.

License
- Add LICENSE (suggest MIT) — I can add it if you confirm the license choice.
